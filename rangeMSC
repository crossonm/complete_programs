/* The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way 
to compute the sum of a range of numbers:

console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));

Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and 
returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end. */

function myRange(start, end) {
    var outArray = []
    for (i = start; i < end+1; i++){
        outArray.push(i)
    }
    console.log(outArray)
}

myRange(1,14)
